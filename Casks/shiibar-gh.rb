# Cask template for the bufferings/homebrew-tap release of Shiibar GH.
#
# A template, not a valid cask: .github/workflows/bump-cask.yml replaces
# 0.1.0 and 301b7c923a34c4b8ede4e0783acf6df4dd6f58a21b5b5d67e1fb19234e0988de when it renders this file into
# Casks/shiibar-gh.rb of bufferings/homebrew-tap for a published release.
# CI renders it with dummy values and runs `brew style --cask` on it.
#
# Apple Silicon only, macOS 14 or later (docs/DESIGN.md, "Distribution and
# signing").

  # "<appdir>/Shiibar GH.app/Contents/Helpers/shiibar-ghd --foreground", and
  # `pkill -x` matches the whole command line only, so a process that merely
  # names the path is left alone.

  caveats <<~EOS
    Open Shiibar GH once: it asks for the notification permission and
    registers itself to launch at login. Add your tokens in Settings ›
    Scopes. The tokens stay in the Keychain (service shiibar-gh) after an
    uninstall; remove them with `shiibar-gh scope remove` before
    uninstalling, or in Keychain Access.
