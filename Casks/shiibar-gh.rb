# Cask template for the bufferings/homebrew-tap release of Shiibar GH.
#
# A template, not a valid cask: .github/workflows/bump-cask.yml replaces
# 0.3.0 and a893908e9721c1d8b52c7fbbba3f3ec7b021144f1b6c52ebe86d8bb318ff07eb when it renders this file into
# Casks/shiibar-gh.rb of bufferings/homebrew-tap for a published release.
# CI renders it with dummy values and runs `brew style --cask` on it.
#
# Apple Silicon only, macOS 14 or later (docs/DESIGN.md, "Distribution and
# signing").

  # names the path is left alone.

  caveats <<~EOS
    Open Shiibar GH once: it asks for the notification permission and
    registers itself to launch at login. Add an account in Settings ›
    Accounts with a classic personal access token (scopes repo,
    notifications, read:org). Version 0.2 does not read the tokens of 0.1:
    add your accounts again. The tokens stay in the Keychain (service
    shiibar-gh, account accounts) after an uninstall; remove them with
    `shiibar-gh token reset` before uninstalling, or in Keychain Access.
